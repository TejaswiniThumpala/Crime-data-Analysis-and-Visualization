# Crime-data-Analysis-and-Visualization
The project is a systematic approach for identifying and analyzing patterns and trends in crime. It can display regions of crime occurred according to year, month, day, hour and can also visualize crime areas according to crime category. This application allows you to toggle between the different types of crime for selected months of the year whose locations are then plotted alongside on the map. The results of this solution could be used to raise peopleâ€™s awareness regarding the dangerous locations.
